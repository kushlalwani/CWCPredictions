    "- One Dataset contains matches that occurred in a team's home league. This dataset contains lots of statistics from each match and will be the one of the most useful datasets for this project. However, the league strength will not be used for anything in this as both teams that face eachother will be in the same league.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The second data set is of the UEFA Champions League. The only useful data this set provides for this application is: both teams that played eachother, the date, and the final score. It will only contain matches that occured between teams with leagues based in Europe.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The third data set is of the CONMEBOL Libertadores. This dataset also only contains columns for the date, teams, and score. This will only contain data for teams that play eachother in South America.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finding data for the North American, Asian, and African Continental compitetions proved difficult. Without the luxury of time for manually scraping the data, It makes more sense to train the model on the data that is readily available, and hope that the model will be able to precisely predict the outcomes. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is also a slight issue with the home leagues dataset, as some of the leagues represented at the Club World Cup are not present in the dataset. For this case, I am hoping that metrics involving league and team strength will be able to achieve good predictions. "

    "I am planning only on using data from the past three seasons to train the model. This is because I only have access to the current team and league strengths. In football, four years is still a very long time, but it is not expected for team's performance to change extremely drastically. So I believe that using current rankings can help to assess the difference between teams in the past four seasons. Since leagues across the globe start at different times, I will use Jan 1st, 2021 as the date to cutoff the data\n",
